### Project Overview

This project entails developing a simple web application where users can click a button to increment and display the number of clicks. The application is divided into three main components:

1. **Backend**: Utilizes FastAPI to handle API requests and manage the click count.
2. **Frontend**: Built with React to provide the user interface for interaction.
3. **Nginx**: Serves as a reverse proxy to efficiently manage and route traffic between the frontend and backend.

The entire setup is orchestrated using Docker Compose to ensure seamless integration and deployment.

### Project Structure

Organize the project with the following directory layout:

- **backend/**: Contains all backend-related files and configurations.
- **frontend/**: Houses the React application files.
- **nginx/**: Includes Nginx configuration and setup.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines and manages the Docker services for the entire application.

## Frontend Development

### 1. Setting Up React

**a. Initialize the Frontend Project**

- Use Create React App to bootstrap the frontend application within the `frontend` directory.
- Install additional dependencies such as Axios for handling HTTP requests.

**b. Develop the React Application**

- Create the main component (`App.js`) that includes:
  - A button for users to click.
  - A display area to show the number of clicks.
- Implement state management to handle the click count.
- Utilize Axios to interact with the backend API:
  - Fetch the initial click count upon component mounting.
  - Send a request to increment the click count when the button is clicked.

**c. Styling the Application**

- Apply basic CSS to ensure the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Organize styles to maintain consistency and responsiveness.

**d. Test the Frontend Locally**

- Run the React application locally to verify that the UI components interact correctly with the backend.
- Ensure that clicking the button updates the displayed click count appropriately.

**e. Dockerize the Frontend**

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the frontend directory to build and serve the React application using Nginx.
- Define the build process and specify how Nginx should serve the static files.
- Build the Docker image for the frontend service.

## Nginx Configuration

### 1. Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

**a. Configure Nginx**

- Create an `nginx` directory within the project root.
- Develop an `nginx.conf` file that:
  - Serves the React frontend.
  - Proxies API requests to the FastAPI backend.
- Ensure that Nginx correctly routes traffic based on URL paths.

**b. Adjust Frontend API Requests**

- Modify the frontend application to route API calls through Nginx by using relative paths.
- This ensures that API requests are correctly proxied to the backend service without exposing backend URLs directly.

**c. Dockerize Nginx**

- Create a `Dockerfile` within the `nginx` directory to containerize the Nginx server.
- Define the steps to copy the Nginx configuration and the built frontend files into the Docker image.
- Build the Docker image for the Nginx service.

---

## Docker Compose Setup

### 1. Orchestrate Services with Docker Compose

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root to define all services:
  - **backend**: Uses the backend Docker image, exposes necessary ports, and connects to the application network.
  - **frontend**: Uses the frontend Docker image, exposes necessary ports, and connects to the application network.
  - **nginx**: Uses the Nginx Docker image, exposes necessary ports, depends on backend and frontend services, and connects to the application network.
- Define a shared network to allow inter-service communication.
- Ensure that service dependencies are correctly specified to manage startup order.

### 2. Build and Deploy the Application

- Use Docker Compose commands to build all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Start all services, ensuring that they run in detached mode for continuous operation.
- Verify that all containers are running correctly and that services are communicating as expected.

### 3. Access the Application

- Open a web browser and navigate to the application's designated URL (e.g., `http://localhost`).
- Interact with the application by clicking the button and observing the click count updates.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Production Environment

- Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the production server.
- Secure the server by configuring firewalls and restricting access to necessary ports only.

### 2. Transfer Project Files to the Server

- Use secure methods such as SCP or Git to transfer the project files to the production server.
- Navigate to the project directory on the server.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

- If necessary, set up environment variables for configurations like allowed CORS origins or database connections.
- Update Docker Compose and application configurations to utilize these environment variables.

### 4. Build and Run Services on the Server

- Execute Docker Compose commands to build and run all services in the production environment.
- Monitor the build process for any errors and ensure that all services start correctly.

### 5. Secure the Application

- Configure Nginx to use SSL certificates for HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.
- Update CORS settings in the backend to allow only trusted origins.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security vulnerabilities.

### 6. Monitor and Maintain

- Implement logging and monitoring solutions to keep track of application performance and issues.
- Set up automated backups if persistent storage is introduced.
- Plan for scaling services as needed based on user traffic and application demands.
