## Frontend Development

### 1. Setting Up React

**a. Initialize the Frontend Project**

- Use Create React App to bootstrap the frontend application within the `frontend` directory.
- Install additional dependencies such as Axios for handling HTTP requests.

**b. Develop the React Application**

- Create the main component (`App.js`) that includes:
  - A button for users to click.
  - A display area to show the number of clicks.
- Implement state management to handle the click count.
- Utilize Axios to interact with the backend API:
  - Fetch the initial click count upon component mounting.
  - Send a request to increment the click count when the button is clicked.

**c. Styling the Application**

- Apply basic CSS to ensure the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Organize styles to maintain consistency and responsiveness.

**d. Test the Frontend Locally**

- Run the React application locally to verify that the UI components interact correctly with the backend.
- Ensure that clicking the button updates the displayed click count appropriately.

**e. Dockerize the Frontend**

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the frontend directory to build and serve the React application using Nginx.
- Define the build process and specify how Nginx should serve the static files.
- Build the Docker image for the frontend service.

## Nginx Configuration

### 1. Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

**a. Configure Nginx**

- Create an `nginx` directory within the project root.
- Develop an `nginx.conf` file that:
  - Serves the React frontend.
  - Proxies API requests to the FastAPI backend.
- Ensure that Nginx correctly routes traffic based on URL paths.

**b. Adjust Frontend API Requests**

- Modify the frontend application to route API calls through Nginx by using relative paths.
- This ensures that API requests are correctly proxied to the backend service without exposing backend URLs directly.

**c. Dockerize Nginx**

- Create a `Dockerfile` within the `nginx` directory to containerize the Nginx server.
- Define the steps to copy the Nginx configuration and the built frontend files into the Docker image.
- Build the Docker image for the Nginx service.

## Docker Compose Setup

### 1. Orchestrate Services with Docker Compose

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root to define all services:
  - **backend**: Uses the backend Docker image, exposes necessary ports, and connects to the application network.
  - **frontend**: Uses the frontend Docker image, exposes necessary ports, and connects to the application network.
  - **nginx**: Uses the Nginx Docker image, exposes necessary ports, depends on backend and frontend services, and connects to the application network.
- Define a shared network to allow inter-service communication.
- Ensure that service dependencies are correctly specified to manage startup order.

### 2. Build and Deploy the Application

- Use Docker Compose commands to build all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Start all services, ensuring that they run in detached mode for continuous operation.
- Verify that all containers are running correctly and that services are communicating as expected.

### 3. Access the Application

- Open a web browser and navigate to the application's designated URL (e.g., `http://localhost`).
- Interact with the application by clicking the button and observing the click count updates.
