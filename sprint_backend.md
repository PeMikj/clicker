## Backend Development

### 1. Setting Up FastAPI

**a. Initialize the Backend Project**

- Create a `backend` directory within the project root.
- Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- Define and install necessary dependencies such as FastAPI and Uvicorn.

**b. Develop the FastAPI Application**

- Create the main application file (`main.py`) within the backend directory.
- Implement API endpoints:
  - A `GET` endpoint to retrieve the current click count.
  - A `POST` endpoint to increment the click count.
- Configure CORS middleware to allow requests from the frontend.

**c. Test the Backend Locally**

- Run the FastAPI server locally to ensure endpoints are functioning correctly.
- Use the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI to verify the endpoints.

**d. Dockerize the Backend**

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the backend directory to containerize the FastAPI application.
- Define the necessary steps to install dependencies and run the application within the Docker container.
- Build the Docker image for the backend service.
